## 1-	Understanding the Data and Analysis Objectives
Introduction:
In this project, we analyzed Airbnb property data (airbnb.csv file – 84*27070) to explore pricing trends, customer demand, the impact of property features, clustering of listings, and other key insights.
Dataset Structure:
*	The dataset contains 84 attributes, including location, price, property type, number of rooms, user ratings, additional costs, and available amenities.
*	This data helps us understand Airbnb market behavior and optimize decision-making.
Analysis Objectives:
-	Provide insights for better pricing strategies and property management.
- Identify seasonal and geographic demand trends.
-	Examine how amenities impact price and guest experience.
-	Recommend strategies to attract more customers and maximize revenue.

## 2-	Performed Analyses and Key Findings
Pricing Analysis and Patterns
•	Most prices range between $50 and $300, but luxury properties can go up to $2,000 per night.
•	Factors like the number of rooms, accommodation capacity, cleaning fees, and location have a direct impact on price.
Review & Rating Analysis
•	The average rating for most listings is between 4.5 and 5, but some properties with lower ratings indicate service quality issues.
•	Most reviews focus on cleanliness, amenities, and location.
Property Clustering Based on Key Features
•	Listings were segmented into four clusters, including budget-friendly, mid-range, luxury, and ultra-luxury properties.
•	Properties in tourist areas and city centers tend to belong to higher-priced clusters.
Impact of Amenities on Pricing
•	Amenities such as swimming pools, private parking, air conditioning, and high-speed internet significantly impact pricing.
•	Properties with premium amenities tend to be 40-50% more expensive than similar properties without them.
Outlier Detection and Correction
•	5% of the data had extreme pricing outliers, which were removed to improve model accuracy.
Seasonal Trends and Market Demand
•	Summer is the peak season for Airbnb, with the highest demand and increased pricing.
•	Winter is typically a low-demand season, leading to price drops.

## 3-	Some AI/ML Model Implementation
The following machine learning models have been implemented to analyze Airbnb listings:
1.	Price Prediction
o	Uses Random Forest Regressor to estimate listing prices based on features such as number of rooms, location, and amenities.
2.	Property Clustering Analysis
o	Applies K-Means Clustering to group listings based on price, location, and other key attributes.
3.	Property Recommendation System
o	Uses Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering to suggest listings based on user preferences and historical data.
4.	Outlier Detection
o	Implements Isolation Forest and Z-score Analysis to identify properties with unusual pricing patterns.
These models help predict price trends, segment properties, recommend listings, and detect anomalies in the dataset.
